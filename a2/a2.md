#### 1. Give a brief explanation of the relationship between inductively defined sets, primitive recursion, and proofs by structural induction.

Inductively defined sets are sets with possibly recursive structure, syntax of primitive recursive functions is defined as an inductively defined set. Also elements of inductively defined sets are often values in primitive recursive functions e.g. Nat. Proofs by structural induction are done by following the structure of inductively defined sets i.e. defining a case for every constructor, which is similar to the way primitive recursive functions are defined.
